# Smegbot

A discord bot that enables you to easily replace all of a given user's roles
with a predefined one. The user's current roles will be saved in case they
need to be restored at a later date.

## Installation

Smegbot is written in Go, so to install you can run the following:
```
go install github.com/dshoreman/smegbot
```

This will install `smegbot` into your `$GOBIN` if it's set, or `$GOPATH/bin` otherwise.
